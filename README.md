# :wave: DECISION-TREES

## What is a decision tree?

A decision tree is a tree-like structure that represents a series of decisions and their possible consequences. It is used in machine learning for classification and regression tasks.

## Classification

In classification tasks, the decision tree is used to predict the class of an example. For example, a decision tree could be used to predict whether an email is spam or not.

## Regression

In regression tasks, the decision tree is used to predict a continuous value. For example, a decision tree could be used to predict the price of a house.

## How does a decision tree work?

A decision tree works by recursively splitting a dataset into smaller and smaller subsets. Each split is based on a decision rule, which is a question that asks about a particular feature of the data. The goal is to split the data into subsets that are as pure as possible, meaning that all examples in a subset have the same class or value.
